# RNN4AP

Evaluation of Recurrent Neural Networks for future Autopilot Systems
This project implements Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM and GRU) and use 
it on a PX4 sensors fusion test case.

### Dependencies

No dependencies, only a C++ compiler is required (only tested on Linux based systems)

### Installation

Typical cmake project
