Important Note: This testcase comes from the paper: 

Narkhede P, Walambe R, Poddar S, Kotecha K. 2021. Incremental learning of
LSTM framework for sensor fusion in attitude estimation. PeerJ Computer
Science 7:e662 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.662

Thanks to them the source code and raw data are available at GitHub: https://github.com/nsparag/LSTM-INC.git

Here, we basically only exported the excel sheet into csv file easier to handle for us.
